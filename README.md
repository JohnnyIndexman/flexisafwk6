# Overview
This Java program demonstrates the use of enums, nested classes, and anonymous classes using a car brand theme.

## Features
Enum (Car): Represents a fixed set of car brands.

**Static Nested Class** (StaticNestedClass): Displays a message including a car brand.

**Non-Static Inner Class** (InnerClass): Accesses and prints a private message from the outer class.

**Anonymous Class** (CarName): Implements an interface to print all available car brands.

## How It Works
The Car enum contains four car brands: BMW, AUDI, MERCEDES, TESLA.

The StaticNestedClass prints a message about getting a Tesla.

The InnerClass prints a private message from OuterClass.

The createAnonymousClass() method creates an anonymous class that prints all car brands.

## Expected Output

**Brand Name**: [BMW, AUDI, MERCEDES, TESLA]
Get me a TESLA car!
I would love to have one these cars!
